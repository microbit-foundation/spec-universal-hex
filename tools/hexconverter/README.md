# Hex Converter Tool

**OUTDATED- DO NOT USE!**

Python tool to convert a normal micro:bit hex file into a hex file in blocks of
data formatted as per the Universal Hex specification version 0.1.0.

This is just a proof-of-concept, many assumptions are made in the code and needs
to be refactored/rewritten before it's ready for production.
