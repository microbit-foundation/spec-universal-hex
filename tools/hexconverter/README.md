# Hex Converter Tool

Python tool to convert a normal micro:bit hex file into a hex file in blocks of
data formatted as per the Universal Hex specification version 0.1.0.

This is just a proof-of-concept, many assumptions are made in the code and needs
to be refactored/rewritten before it's ready for production.

TODO: Review and merge https://github.com/microbit-foundation/DAPLink-builds/pull/10
and then update the code here.
